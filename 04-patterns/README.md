# Patterns

1. number of lines == number of rows == number of times the outer loop runs.
2. Identify for every row how many columns are there, what are the types of elements and how the columns are changing in relation to the rows.
3. Identify what do you need to print.



### Note: 
```py range()``` function starts from `0` if we do not specify starting point.
