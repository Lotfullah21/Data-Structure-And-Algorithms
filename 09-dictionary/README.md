<h1>Dictionary {}</h1>
<p>it allows us to associate one value to another value.
association between values are done using key-value pair.
Keys must be unique

</p>

<h5>students = {"name":"Ahmad","age":24,"school":"Harvard"}</h5>
<p>Indexing is done using key elements</p>
<p>There is no particular order</p>

<h2>Values</h2>
<ul>
<li>can be duplicate</li>
<li>can be int,float,strings,tuples (immutable and mutable type)</li>
<li>it can be a list or a dictionary</li>
</ul>

<h2>Keys</h2>
<ul>
<li>Must be unique</li>
<li>can be int,float,strings,tuples,bool</li>
<li>it can be a list or a dictionary</li>
</ul>

<h1>Tuples</h1>
tuples are ordered sequence of elements, by ordered we mean, it can be indexed, or we can get the element in the sequence by specific indexing

1. they are immutables,which means once 2. values assigned cannot be changed later.

2. tuple values lives inside parenthesis ()

3. tuples can have different kind of values

4. adding two tuples is possible, but it does not mean adding their values, rather they will be putted side by side, we can call this concatenation.
